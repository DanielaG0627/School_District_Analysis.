# PyCity Schools District Analysis

## Purpose
Maria, the Chief Data Scientist of the PyCity School District is tasked with all standardized test data for analysis, reporting and presentations to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussion and strategic decisions at the shcool and district level.

I have helped Maria analyze data on student funding and student math and reading test scores. Trends in school performance have been provided in order to help the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities.
